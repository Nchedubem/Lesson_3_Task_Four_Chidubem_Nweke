                <p>
                   Social change is a common feature of social reality that widely described and explained the evolution of human societies as well as the transformation in the basic components of human society right from the traditional to modern-day societies. There are alterations in social values, norms, institutions, relationships and	 stratification as a result of internal and external forces of social change. The external forces are events	that occurred on a large scale, affecting an entire	 nation or several nations altogether such as climate change. 
                   While internal forces are events that occurred on a small scale causing internal structural rearrangements with greater influences on the social fabric of the society, i.e. demographic change.

                    While a negative social change shows the dysfunction in the entire	or some parts of social structures and	institutions which in turn destabilize	human and social development.

                <h3>Some social changes in Nigeria</h3>
                <p>
                   1. Poverty. 60% of residents in Nigeria live in poverty, lacking access to sufficient resources such as healthcare, schooling, and income. With more of the population in poverty, there is lower standard of living among the population. This is also due to high unemployment, with over 25% of Nigerians without a job. The government is struggling to create new jobs and investments, leading to higher inequality within the country.
                </P>
                <P>
                   2. Inequality in share of dividends of democracy. Inequality in terms of access to social amenities. 
                </P>
                <p>
                   3. Terrorism. The Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria is strictly against western culture, including voting, religion and secular education. Their means of fighting against these cultural differences is by kidnapping, attacking, and killing people, communities, and different religious groups
